The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

**NOTE: if you selected `deploy-own` option please follow the instructions in the `pact` directory README to deploy your own contract and start interacting with it as it will show errors until app finds your contract instance deployed on-chain**

### `npm test`

### `npm build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
